Airbnb provides a platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short-term lodging and tourism-related activities.Guests can search for lodging using filters such as lodging type, dates, location, and price. Guests have the ability to search for specific types of homes, such as bed and breakfasts, unique homes, and vacation homes. Hosts provide prices and other details for their rental or event listings, such as the allowed number of guests, home type, rules, and amenities. Pricing is determined by the host, with recommendations from Airbnb Hosts and guests have the ability to leave reviews about the experience.
